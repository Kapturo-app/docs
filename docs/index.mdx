# Welcome to Kapturo

Kapturo is the bridge between your daily consumption and your creative output. It’s a tool designed to help you capture what inspires you, synthesize your unique knowledge, and amplify your voice through powerful, authentic content.

## The problem: trapped knowledge

Every day, you encounter a mountain of valuable information—in articles, charts, messages, and notes. But this knowledge is scattered. When it's time to create, you're left facing a blank page, unable to connect the dots. Generic AI tools can't help because they lack your context, your experience, and your unique point of view.

## The solution: your voice, amplified

Kapturo solves this broken workflow by connecting directly to your personal stream of knowledge. It's built on a simple yet powerful philosophy: the best content comes from a collaboration between your insights and intelligent tools.

It’s not about replacing your thinking. **It’s about amplifying it.**

### How it works: the 3-step flow

Kapturo's workflow is designed to be seamless and intuitive.

1.  **Capture:** Effortlessly save ideas, quotes, and visuals from anywhere using the native macOS app. Add your personal notes to give them context.
2.  **Synthesize:** Kapturo organizes your captures into a private, searchable library. The AI analyses your saved knowledge to propose unique content angles.
3.  **Create:** Collaborate with the AI through a conversational interface. It asks questions to draw out your expertise, then drafts and refines content that is 100% in your voice.
