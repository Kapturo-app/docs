# Your knowledge, finally connected.

Kapturo turns your scattered reading and notes into a single, intelligent knowledge base. From there, you have two powerful ways to put that knowledge to work: **explore** it for deep insights or **create** authentic social content.

## The problem: trapped knowledge

Every day, you encounter a mountain of valuable information—in articles, charts, messages, and notes. But this knowledge is scattered. When it's time to create, you're left facing a blank page, unable to connect the dots. Generic AI tools can't help because they lack your context, your experience, and your unique point of view.

## The solution: your knowledge, connected

Kapturo solves this broken workflow by turning your scattered captures into a connected knowledge base. It's built on a simple philosophy: the best insights and content come from a collaboration between your expertise and intelligent tools.

It’s not about replacing your thinking. **It’s about amplifying it.**

### One knowledge base, two powerful workflows

Kapturo's workflow is designed to be seamless and intuitive.

1.  **Capture:** Effortlessly save ideas, quotes, and visuals from anywhere using the native macOS app. Every capture builds your private knowledge base.

2.  **Explore:** Chat with your entire knowledge base in Explore mode. Ask complex questions, find hidden connections, and draft long-form content like reports and articles.

3.  **Create:** Use the guided Create workflow for fast, authentic social posts. The AI uses your captures and personas to help you craft content for LinkedIn and X.
